<b>How to Help</b><br>

About 800,000 people commit suicide worldwide every year, of these 135,000 (17%) are residents of India,a nation with 17.5% of world population. Between 1987 and 2007, the suicide rate increased from 7.9 to 10.3 per 100,000, with higher suicide rates in southern and eastern states of India. In 2012, Tamil Nadu (12.5% of all suicides), Maharashtra (11.9%) and West Bengal (11.0%) had the highest proportion of suicides. Among large population states, Tamil Nadu and Kerala had the highest suicide rates per 100,000 people in 2012. The male to female suicide ratio has been about 2:1.

Estimates for number of suicides in India vary. For example, a study published in Lancet projected 187,000 suicides in India in 2010, while official data by the Government of India claims 134,600 suicides in the same year.

According to WHO data, the age standardized suicide rate in India is 16.4 per 100,000 for women (6th highest in the world) and 25.8 for men (ranking 22nd).<br>

Suicide is preventable. And that starts with knowing what to look for and what to do.<br>

If you or someone you know is thinking about suicide, call the us at Aasra(91-22-27546669). It's always open, and you can speak to a trained counselor.<br>
